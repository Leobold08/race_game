        "You've been given a driver-in-training car for the purpose of this map."

    "driving": [
        "Use WASD to control your car.",
        "W and S move forward and backward, and A and D steer your car left and right.",
        "Pressing (left) Shift starts braking.",
        "This works differently from going backwards and is also much quicker.",
        "Go ahead and clear this course to get a feel for the controls.",
        "Great!"

    "driving_2": [
        "Now let's learn about terrain.",
        "Driving on a road is preferred, as driving on grass slows you down.",
        "See the difference here...",
        "Any body of water will instantly respawn you at the nearest checkpoint.",
        "Avoid the grass; try to pass this part without touching it.",
        "Great!",
        "Nice work, even if you did touch the grass."

    "controls": [
        "There are more controls that I'll let you know about.",
        "Pressing L toggles long lights.",
        "Pressing C toggles the underlight.",
        "You can pause the game with ESC, in case it wasn't obvious.",
        "We aren't required to test you with those controls, so we'll move on now.",
        "The most important aspect is up next."
    ],

    "drifting": [
        "To drift, hold SPACE while moving.",
        "Go ahead.",
        "Nice job! We had to measure your time on that, by the way.",
        "You did pretty good.",
        "You did alright.",
        "You did... okay, I guess.",
        "You could've done better.",
        "Based on it, you shouldn't be driving, but I'll let this one slide.",
        "It's important to be fast, but it's also important to get score.",
        "Score is accumulated only from ACTUAL drifting.",
        "Your time and score determine your rank, given at the end of the map."
